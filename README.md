# gambling_dashboards

This is a place where dashboards and other reports for gambling stuff can live. They don't have to live here, but it's nice to keep stuff tidy.

Most of the tools here were built using functions from the `betfinder` package which you can find [here.](github.com/jimtheflash/betfinder)
